## Important Updates
1. [Wasabi Wallet is no longer Trust Worthy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wasabi-wallets-coinjoin-coordinator-to-blacklist-certain-bitcoin-transactions "Wasabi Not Private")
2. [US GOV has cracked Wasabi Wallet](https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/ "US Gov Cracked Wasabi")
3. The most trusted security lies with YOU! 

This is going to be one of the most important Newsletters you receive. Today we're going to deal with your right to privacy. I've had a lot of conversations about this lately.. so let's get into it. 

If you're used to investing then you're used to going to an exchange like Robinhood, Webull, Fidelity or any of the other ones out there and the exchange asking for a ton of personal information. It's no different in the crypto world. The problem is, regulators are literally still trying to wrap their minds around it-as the dollar loses value and the god honest truth is [they still don't know what they're talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr-Y2JCpK7E "Clueless").. The future is coming and it's coming fast. 

Brett Harrison is the President of FTX.. read his tweet in its entirety [here](https://twitter.com/Brett_FTXUS/status/1500567182757011459?s=20&t=YL1ZH78HFN6B94o35xNDog "How Exchanges Enforce KYC"):


When you register to any exchange to exchange dollars to crypto and crypto back into dollars, you have to submit yourself to a long arduous list of questions to verify your identity. In case you've been under a rock for the past few months, the LA Lakers Staples Center has been renamed to FTX stadium. The crypto community took this as a huge win... and for the mass adoption of crypto it is-but I want you to look at what great lengths the government will go through to link your personal finances.

In the event you thought you could [escape this](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chainalysis%3A-watching-those-who-are-watching-us), what exactly are your options? How exactly can you escape this surveillance and stop 1984/'Brave New World' from hindering your movements?

## Utilizing CEX (Centralized Exchanges):
* GET OFF OF Centralized Exchanges and move your assets to 
non-custodial/self-custodial wallets; hardware or software alternatives. 
* CEX's are prone to: 
1. stopping trading 
2. halting ability to transfer your crypto back into fiat if there is a perfect 
selling opportunity 
3. prone to attacks and hacking (remember.. unless you expose your 
private keys, you don't expose yourself to hacks-Not your keys 
though.. not your crypto). 


## Utilizing DEX's (Decentralized Exchanges):
● There are a few Dex's I can think of, but we first have to learn how to swap from one BioStackTicians 
currency to another. 
1. Exchanges (CEX or DEX) 
2. Atomic Swaps 
3. 3rd Party Exchange Swaps 


## P2P 
(Please understand the fees you have to deal with before you interact with a merchant. That being said, it may be more beneficial to yourself to be the merchant)

* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) Buy and sell bitcoin for fiat (or other cryptocurrencies) privately and securely using Bisq's peer-to-peer network and open-source desktop software. No registration required. 
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) Buy and Sell Bitcoin Everywhere 
* [Boltz Exchange](https://boltz.exchange/) Not really P2P, but what you do is send your BTC over there to get them Privatized. An exchange doesn’t need to know what you’re doing with your money or how much you have for that matter. 
* [KYCnot.me](https://kycnot.me/ "More Options") Is a link you'll definitely want to bookmark.

***
## What kind of wallet are you using? 
* Does the wallet (cold, warm or hot) support Multi-currencies?
    1. Cold
    2. Warm
    3. Hot 
- Does the wallet support swapping and does it support Atomic Swaps or utilize 3rd parties to swap on exchanges for you? 

### Is the wallet you are using HD Hierarchical Deterministic?
* In short, the HD wallet generates a new address to make Chainalysis tracking more difficult. 
* Are you running your own Node? 
    1.  Running a bitcoin full node is the only way to interact with the network in a truly sovereign way. 

***
## Running your own node 
Depending on the software you run along with your node can: 
* Increase privacy by implementing the TOR network 
* Merge your crypto into a CoinJoin, erasing KYC-tained crypto 
* The most private way to interact with the Bitcoin network. 
* Connect to and manage your Dojo from anywhere with an easy to use 
interface served over a Tor hidden service. 
If privacy in these matters is still a question for you, just look back at history when the US government confiscated the gold of citizens in the Bretton Woods Agreement. If you've made it this far, keep in mind that the average life-span of Fiat Currency in history is 27 years and the average lifespan of an empire is 250 years.

## Thoughts:
> The biggest complaint I keep hearing from people is that they can't afford to invest right now. I know personally, I set aside a set amount per month, but can only recommend you invest disposable income. Bitcoin especially, is just one of those assets you want to have long term vision with-and not worry about transferring it back into dollars. The vision here is that one day 1 satoshi will be worth $1 in today's standard.

## UPDATE: 
Now.. Even as the news was coming in and I was crafting the content for the email distro and dwelling on the idea of this Newsletter idea I was simultaneously standing up my own Samurai Node. I’m actually cheating and using Ronin Dojo since I’m hosting my own node off of a Raspberry Pi4. 
For some of you, if I blew your mind and you have no idea what I’m talking about then just keep reading. Firstly, a Raspberry Pi is a Small Board Computer (i.e. SBC) that, on a good day, runs around $35. Additional accessories can increase the price. If feasible, try and obtain either the 4Gb or 8Gb implementations. The 2Gb is good, but we want ‘BETTER’. 

### About Samurai Wallet

Listen.. Everyone is partial to what they like and don’t like in terms of wallets, but here at BioStackTicians, we spend a lot of time getting down to the bottom of things to help us all learn. 
Thanks for walking with me on this personal journey. In each of these Newsletters I’ll try to continue giving you what I feel is relevant information to keep you posted and all of us knowledgeable.
