Robosats has been considered a Bisq clone with Lightning & Tor capabilities.

Market makers create offers to buy or sell bitcoin and name a payment method and a spread. Takers check the list of offers and take ones that appeal to them. Both parties put up 1% of the trade as collateral which they get back at the end of the trade if all goes well. Robosats uses hodl invoices and cancels the collateral payment at the end of the trade. Trades have a time limit of 6 hours.

After collateral is deposited, the bitcoin seller sends the amount of bitcoin in the contract to robosats using another hodl invoice. Robosats keeps the payment pending for now and tells the bitcoin buyer it's time for them to send the USD (or other tender) to the bitcoin seller. Robosats waits til the seller confirms they received the money or opens a dispute. If there is no dispute within the 6 hour time limit or if the bitcoin seller confirms they received the money, robosats settles the seller's payment, uses those funds to pay the bitcoin buyer, and boom, the trade is done.

Buyers and sellers have a rating system and there is a cool no-login-required setup where a new identity is generated for users every time they go to the site (with one caveat, see next sentence). The identity is tied to a password-like string that the site gives you, and you can optionally restore an old identity by typing it into a box on the homepage (that way you can get your ratings back). The site is called robosats because all users get a robot avatar.
