The following information is for those who choose to take crypto seriously and self custody their own assets.  These are just some quick notes that I will continue to expound upon as time goes on.

## If it's not your KEYs, it's not your Crypto!
- Write down your seed phrases down & store them in a safe place
1. These usually come in 2 forms, 12 or 24 word seed phrases
2. Depending on the blockchain, you may be able to use the same seed phrases in another wallet.
3. Feel free to create multiple wallets in say your Metamask.  This enables you to expose your metamask wallet to airdrops without risking the security of your other crypto assets.

## Downloading Applications
Don't trust.. verify!
1. Research your project or wallet
2. Ensure you access the official project website
3. Follow their download links
	- Legit links point directly to Apple & Google Playstore 
	- Legit links may also point directly to the (google) .apk's
