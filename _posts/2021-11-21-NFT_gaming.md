Imagine building a character in GrandTheft Auto.  Building their endurance, speed and just making them entirely unique.  Getting special weapons or vehicles within the game and then selling them on the NFT marketplace.

Our kids are going to have an entirely different future than we did.  With that said, there's a couple of terms you should know.  Some games are F2P (Free to Play), P2P (Pay to Play) and P2E (Play to Earn).

You still have the option of not being a gamer at all and just invest in a particular project you like.  All up to you.  I occasionally take a peek at the metaverse to see what piques my interest and these projects certainly stand out.

[Phantom Galaxies](https://phantomgalaxies.com/)  Register your metamask to obtain a free NFT.  Plus this game looks sick!!!  
[Dragon Kart](https://dragonkart.com/)  

Need I say more?!?  Opportunities for everyone!!
